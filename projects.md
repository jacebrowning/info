I enjoy building command-line utilities to automate developments tasks. Lately, I've been getting into more web development for fun. This projects list is more or less in order of completion date.

## Doorstop

For my masters thesis at [GVSU](https://www.gvsu.edu/), I built a tool to help manage engineering requirements using version control:

* [doorstop.readthedocs.io](https://doorstop.readthedocs.io/)

I am no longer actively working on this program, but many people continue to find it useful in their projects.

## GR Parks

A local "civic hacking" group, [Citizen Labs](http://citizenlabs.org/), started a project with the City of Grand Rapids to display parks millage dollars on a map:

* [grparks.citizenlabs.org](http://grparks.citizenlabs.org/)

We hope to be able to produce similar maps for other municipalities and exploring additional datasets.

## GitMan

At several jobs, we ran into the problem of needing to manage multiple Git repositories and found Git's submodules feature to be lacking. Out of this need, a new command-line utility arose:

* [gitman.readthedocs.io](https://gitman.readthedocs.io/)

I still use this tool nearly every day to simplify the task of closing lots of Git repositories for work. Read more [on the blog]({% post_url 2015-08-07-replacing-submodules-with-gitman %}).

## MemeGen.link

My most entertaining project is a website and API to generate memes:

* [memegen.link](https://memegen.link)

Many chat bots have been written to use the API and the service continues to get around 30k image requests per day. Read more [on the blog]({% post_url 2016-01-24-google-analytics-on-image-requests %}).

## The Coverage Space

The newest project on this list is an API to track code coverage metrics:

* [coverage.space](https://coverage.space/)

I have already started using this in most of my projects to detect when code coverage decreases. Read more [on the blog]({% post_url 2016-09-30-coverage-as-a-service %}).
