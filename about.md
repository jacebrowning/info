I build, customize, integrate, and teach engineering software tools. With degrees in computer engineering and computer science, I am familiar with software development across multiple industries on a variety of platforms. Iâ€™ve worked on products in the embedded, mobile, and web space, but my expertise is Python programming. Sharing knowledge and active involvement in the local tech community are integral parts of my life and career.
