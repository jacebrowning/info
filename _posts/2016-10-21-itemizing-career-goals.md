When I was searching for my last job, I found it useful to make a list of all the things I was looking for in a new career. As it turned out, there were actually two categories within these requirements. Upon making a list, I found that I both cared about the company I worked for and the job at hand.

I encourage everyone to make similar lists as a way to learn about your true career goals. You might be surprised that you want something different than you have. I will attempt to maintain these lists as my perspective changes, but here they are.

## Company Requirements

1. Work on new products with friends

2. Build tools for software engineers

3. Work in an industry that strongly interests me:
  - politics
  - music
  - theme parks

4. Work at "a Python shop"

5. Consult teams and companies on:
  - Automation
  - Quality Assurance
  - Testing
  - Agile Methodologies
  - DevOps

6. Get paid to work on open source software

## Job Requirements

1. Feel like at least half of the team cares more than I do

2. Flexible working hours and support for asynchronous work

3. Work on a team that hates bugs and insists on prioritizing bugs first

4. Have some free work time for side projects

5. To have a dedicated conference budget
